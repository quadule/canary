- Every recorded click and text entry goes through the human helpers
  `page.humanClick(target)` / `page.humanFill(target, text)` (`target` is a selector string or a
  locator) — this is the default, not an option. Do NOT use raw `page.click` / `locator.click` /
  `page.fill` for a recorded action. The helpers reveal the element (scroll it into view), glide
  the on-screen cursor onto it and let it settle, then act through real input — a true click, and
  for fills a focus-then-type that sends real key events. That cursor-settling beat is the point:
  a bare `locator.click()` moves and presses in the same instant, so on camera the click lands
  before the cursor has visibly arrived. (Gestures the helpers don't cover — `hover`, keyboard
  `press`, `selectOption`, drag — use the normal locator methods, still on a revealed element.)
- ALWAYS reveal an element before interacting — no exceptions; the recording must show every
  interaction a viewer is asked to trust. The helpers scroll to the target but cannot reveal an
  element hidden behind collapsed UI — if
  it lives inside a closed menu, dropdown, accordion, tab, or unopened modal, open that container
  first (as its own action), then interact. Any `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded` / `page.isVisible(sel)`
  checks fold into the interaction's own script — keep them out of the step list as bookkeeping.
- Toggle a checkbox or radio by clicking its LABEL, not the input — apps routinely hide the real
  `<input>` and draw a custom control with CSS, so the input is zero-size/invisible and clicking
  it fails or does nothing. `humanClick` the visible label text (`getByText("Accept terms")`, or
  the `<label>`); a user clicks the words and the box, not the hidden input.
- Before interacting, make sure the target isn't covered by an overlay or modal — a cookie
  banner, dialog, toast, or loading spinner. A click that fails with "intercepts pointer events" /
  "not clickable" means something is on top: deal with that overlay first (act within the modal,
  accept/close the banner, wait for the spinner to clear), then retry — don't `{ force: true }`
  through it. Right after a navigation, check for such overlays before starting the main flow.
- Move between pages the way a user does: click links and buttons, don't `goto` internal URLs.
  The lone exception is the flow's entry point — the first navigation is a `page.goto(...)`;
  after that, reach each new page by clicking your way there.
- Find elements the way a user reads them — `getByRole(role, { name })`, `getByText`,
  `getByLabel`. CSS selectors and `page.evaluate(...)` are fine for EXAMINING the page, but when
  a selector is unavoidable in a recorded action prefer a `data-testid` / `data-test-id`
  attribute; never hardcode presentational class names.
- Never bypass real input: no `{ force: true }`, no `page.evaluate(el => el.click())`, and for a
  field the user types into don't set the value with the atomic `page.fill` (it writes in one
  step with no typing on camera — that's why `humanFill` types key by key instead). If a real
  user couldn't see and perform the interaction, the run hasn't verified anything and the video
  shows nothing.
- Don't submit the instant you finish an interaction — this applies to EVERY input before a
  submit, not just typing: checking a box, choosing a radio, selecting a dropdown option, and
  filling a field all commonly trigger async work — inline validation, a newly revealed or
  required field, a dependent control, the submit button enabling/disabling. After each such
  interaction let the page settle (`await page.waitForSettled()` if anything's in flight) and
  check what changed — a validation message, a new field, the button's state — before moving on,
  and re-check once more right before you submit. Firing submit into a mid-validation form records
  a failure that isn't the app's fault, and a real user wouldn't do it either.
- A click timeout or `page.isVisible(sel)` returning false usually means hidden, not missing:
  snapshot, find the toggle/menu/tab that reveals the element, click that, then retry.
