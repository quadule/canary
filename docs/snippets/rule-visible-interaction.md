- Every recorded click and text entry goes through the human helpers
  `page.humanClick(target)` / `page.humanFill(target, text)` (`target` is a selector string or a
  locator) — this is the default, not an option. Do NOT use raw `page.click` / `locator.click` /
  `page.fill` for a recorded action. The helpers reveal the element (scroll it into view), glide
  the on-screen cursor onto it and let it settle, then act through real input — a true click, and
  for fills a focus-then-type that sends real key events. That cursor-settling beat is the point:
  a bare `locator.click()` moves and presses in the same instant, so on camera the click lands
  before the cursor has visibly arrived. (Gestures the helpers don't cover — `hover`, keyboard
  `press`, `selectOption`, drag — use the normal locator methods, still on a revealed element.)
- ALWAYS reveal an element before interacting — no exceptions; the recording must show every
  interaction a viewer is asked to trust. The helpers scroll to the target but cannot reveal an
  element hidden behind collapsed UI — if
  it lives inside a closed menu, dropdown, accordion, tab, or unopened modal, open that container
  first, then interact — in the SAME step. A toggle-opened container (a menu/dropdown) STAYS open
  across steps, so if you opened it in an earlier step (e.g. to snapshot and find the item), do NOT
  click the toggle again to "open" it — that CLOSES it; just click the item. Any
  `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded` / `page.isVisible(sel)` checks fold into the interaction's own script —
  keep them out of the step list as bookkeeping.
- To bring something into view just to SHOW it (not act on it), use `page.reveal(target)` — never
  `window.scrollTo` or `page.evaluate(() => scrollTo(...))`, which move nothing the camera can see.
  Observing doesn't need scrolling at all: `snapshotForAI` reads the whole page regardless of scroll.
- Toggle a checkbox or radio with `humanClick` — target it by role/name
  (`getByRole("checkbox", { name })`) or its label text. Apps routinely hide the real `<input>` and
  draw a custom control with CSS, so the input is zero-size and a direct click misses; `humanClick`
  detects that and clicks the input's `<label>` for you (what a real user clicks). You don't need
  to find the label yourself — just don't reach past `humanClick` to a raw `click` on the input.
- Before interacting, make sure the target isn't covered by an overlay or modal — a cookie
  banner, dialog, toast, or loading spinner. A click that fails with "intercepts pointer events" /
  "not clickable" means something is on top: deal with that overlay first (act within the modal,
  accept/close the banner, wait for the spinner to clear), then retry — don't `{ force: true }`
  through it. Right after a navigation, check for such overlays before starting the main flow.
- When several `<dialog>` elements coexist in the DOM at once (a modal, a drawer, …), don't rely
  on `isVisible()` / `isHidden()` to pick the active one — frameworks often show/hide a `<dialog>`
  with CSS while it stays `open` in the DOM, so Playwright's visibility heuristic can report the
  truly-shown one as `false`. Identify it by content instead: `page.locator("dialog", { hasText:
  "…" })` / `page.getByRole("dialog", { name: "…" })`, or scope straight to a known descendant
  inside it — rather than testing `.isVisible()` across every match and trusting the boolean.
- Move between pages the way a user does: click links and buttons, don't `goto` internal URLs.
  The lone exception is the flow's entry point — the first navigation is a `page.goto(...)`;
  after that, reach each new page by clicking your way there.
- Find elements the way a user reads them — `getByRole(role, { name })`, `getByText`,
  `getByLabel`. CSS selectors and `page.evaluate(...)` are fine for EXAMINING the page, but when
  a selector is unavoidable in a recorded action prefer a `data-testid` / `data-test-id`
  attribute; never hardcode presentational class names.
- Never bypass real input: no `{ force: true }`, no `page.evaluate(el => el.click())`, and for a
  field the user types into don't set the value with the atomic `page.fill` (it writes in one
  step with no typing on camera — that's why `humanFill` types key by key instead). If a real
  user couldn't see and perform the interaction, the run hasn't verified anything and the video
  shows nothing.
- Don't submit the instant you finish an interaction — this applies to EVERY input before a
  submit, not just typing: checking a box, choosing a radio, selecting a dropdown option, and
  filling a field all commonly trigger async work — inline validation, a newly revealed or
  required field, a dependent control, the submit button enabling/disabling. After each such
  interaction wait on the CONCRETE result before moving on — assert or act on the thing that
  changed (the validation message appearing, the new/required field rendering, the submit button
  flipping enabled); Playwright auto-waits when you act on it. Re-check the submit control is
  enabled right before you submit. Firing submit into a mid-validation form records a failure that
  isn't the app's fault, and a real user wouldn't do it either.
- A click timeout or `page.isVisible(sel)` returning false usually means hidden, not missing:
  snapshot, find the toggle/menu/tab that reveals the element, click that, then retry.
