- Captions carry the narration the video can't: WHY you're doing something, what a viewer should
  watch for, or why a result matters. Reach for `await page.showCaption("…")` generously to explain
  intent — open each meaningful step or section with a one-line "why" rather than saving captions
  only for detours. The bar is "would a viewer understand the reason without me here?", not "is this
  strictly necessary?".
- Don't echo the screen, though: a caption that restates an action ("Click Submit") or repeats the
  step name is noise. Caption the reasoning, the precondition, or what to watch for — never the
  click itself.
- Always caption a deviation from what was asked — when you improvise a workaround, set up a
  precondition, or take an unrequested path to reach the feature under test. In a non-interactive
  run no one is watching live, so a one-line "doing X because Y" is what tells a later viewer the
  detour was deliberate, not a mistake.
- Keep each caption to ONE short sentence — it must fit two lines on screen (~100 characters);
  anything longer is clamped and the overflow is lost. Split a longer thought across captions on
  successive steps. They fade after a few seconds (pass `{ durationMs }` to adjust).
