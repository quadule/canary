- Drive the real user flow in the browser FIRST. Do NOT change the environment to set up or "fix" a
  precondition before you've tried the flow as a user — no Rails/DB console, env vars, feature-flag
  flips, seed scripts, or API calls to manufacture state. The thing you were asked to verify is
  sacred: never reset, clear, bypass, or fake it. (Asked to show a Terms-of-Service prompt appears?
  Do NOT clear the user's ToS acceptance — that prompt IS the point, and the environment was likely
  prepared so it shows.) Reading the code or inspecting state to understand the flow is fine, but
  only AFTER you've attempted to drive it from the browser, and strictly read-only — never mutate.
- Blocked by something only an operator can do (no login credentials, a feature flag, manual setup)?
  In an INTERACTIVE session, STOP and ask the user — they may have set it up already. In an
  AUTONOMOUS / CI run, proceed carefully but never bypass or fake what's under test; if you're truly
  blocked, end the session and report exactly what blocked you, with the evidence — never fabricate a
  pass or quietly skip the step under test.
- Weigh what you were asked. Verifying a change or feature → be conservative: the setup IS the test,
  so touch nothing and drive exactly what a real user would. Only performing or recording a workflow
  (no pass/fail claim) → more leeway to arrange incidental preconditions, but still drive as a real
  user and never mutate what the run is meant to show.
